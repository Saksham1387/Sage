Technologies Used

	•	Frontend:
	•	Next.js - React framework for building server-rendered web apps
	•	Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
	•	Backend:
	•	Python - Language used for the recommendation engine
	•	FastAPI - For building REST APIs in backend-proxy/main.py
	•	AI Techniques: NLP models, semantic search, recommendation algorithms

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	•	Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine
	•	Python 3.9+
	•	Virtual Environment tools such as venv or virtualenv (recommended)

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sage-ai.git
cd sage-ai


	2.	Install frontend dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Set up environment variables:
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables for your Next.js app.
	4.	(Optional) Install Python dependencies for the backend:
Navigate to the backend-proxy folder:

cd backend-proxy

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt



Backend Proxy

The backend for Sage AI is located in the backend-proxy directory, where the core recommendation logic is written in Python. This backend serves as a proxy to handle requests from the Next.js frontend and provide AI-powered recommendations.

	•	File Structure:
	•	main.py: Contains the FastAPI code that handles user requests and routes them to the recommendation engine.
	•	Starting the Backend:

cd backend-proxy
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate your virtual environment
uvicorn main:app --reload

This will start the backend server locally, running at http://localhost:8000.

Running the Application

Running the Frontend

To run the Next.js frontend, use:

npm run dev

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

Running the Backend

Navigate to the backend-proxy directory and run the backend as described in the Backend Proxy section.

The frontend will communicate with the backend to fetch recommendations.
